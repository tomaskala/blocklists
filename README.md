# blocklists

Adblock Plus-compatible blocklists of various spammy websites plaguing search
results. These typically contain scraped or machine-translated pages from
github or stack-overflow.

After applying the blocklist, these pages will be removed from DuckDuckGo and
Google search results.


## Usage

In uBlock Origin, paste the link to the raw version of
[blocklist.txt](blocklist.txt) into the `Custom` field in the `Filter lists`
tab.
